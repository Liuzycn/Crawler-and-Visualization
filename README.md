# Crawler-and-Visualization

This is a small program about crawler and visualization.

## Program Overview

The goal of the project I completed this time is to crawl the barrage of the 2022 college entrance examination math video of station B. At that time, the background of the completion of the project was that it was the end of the 2022 college entrance examination, and the demand for college entrance examination mathematics on the Internet was also the loudest
Target. Through the word cloud chart and bar chart drawing of people's comments, it is beneficial for readers to understand more directly that people are complaining about 2022
What are the key words of mathematics in the college entrance examination, and the intrinsic relationship between them.
1. Draw a word cloud map of high-frequency words in the barrage by crawling out the danmaku data.
2. Select the crawled data with more than one occurrence and use pandas to process it, and write it to a csv file.
3. Then select the top 10 words with the most occurrences and plot them to show how many times they appear and what percentage they have
Bar charts as well as pie charts.
4. Finally, with the help of a video of a college entrance examination math review on WeChat, by manually calling up the IP addresses of its first 275 users,
A map of China that shows the percentage of commenters by province (the sample size is too small, so the statistical significance of the map is relatively large
Small)
